# Part 1

To begin with, let's just start with an application that shows a welcome message to the user, then rolls a single 6-sided die and shows the result to the user.

Although this is quite simple, there are already some things to look out for that will keep your code clean:

 - Make sure that any variables you declare are well-named. Is it obvious just from the names you've chosen what they're being used for?

 - It can often be helpful to introduce whitespace (blank lines) in your code just to separate blocks of code that do different things.

 Once you've got something you're happy with, push it to GitHub and show your trainer. Head over to [Part 2](part2.md) once you've done that.
