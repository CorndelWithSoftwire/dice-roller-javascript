# Dice Roller

This guide will walk you through creating a small application whose requirements evolve and change as the program grows. The focus here is to learn how to keep your code clean and tidy, which can become difficult when adding functionality to an already-existitng application.

This application you'll be making is not as complex as real-world applications, so you'll probably find that you're able to keep writing code that works without worrying too much about keeping it neat and tidy. Don't be satisfied with that! The idea of this exercise is to learn a few things to look out for when writing code that will let you keep on top of your codebase and not let its complexity outgrow you.

After each part, push your solution to GitHub and ask your trainer to give you some feedback on whether there's anything that can be improved. Remember, we're looking for _great_ code, not just working code.

## Background

The local tabletop RPG group has lost all their dice, but they won't let that stop them from having their fun. They've tasked you with writing them a program that they can use to come up with random dice rolls for them.
