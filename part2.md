# Part 2

In this part, you should extend your application to let the user roll as many dice as they like, and show the result of each roll.

Do this by asking them to enter the number of dice they would like to roll, and then rolling that many dice in a row (for example in a loop).

You should be looking out for the same things as in Part 1:

 - Ensure that your variables are well-named and their use is clear.

 - Does your code fall into distinct sections that can be demarcated by helpful whitespace?

Remember to push your code and show your trainer before moving onto [Part 3](part3.md)
