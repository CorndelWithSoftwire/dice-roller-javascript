# Part 3

Your friends at the tabletop RPG group have informed you that in their games, they don't always use 6-sided dice - they often use 4-sided, 8-sided, 12-sided and 20-sided dice, and so they need your application to support dice with an arbitrary number of faces.

Enhance your application so that when it starts up, it asks the user for the size of dice they want to use.

You'll notice as you do this that your program now has two places where it asks the user to enter a number. When you spot that you have different pieces of code doing essentially the same thing, that's a good time to create a method which does that thing and use the method instead of repeating the code several times.

Have a think about a method that gets an integer input from the user. What return type should the method have? What inputs might it need? Can you think of a good name for your method?

Once you have a working solution, don't forget to show it to your trainer for feedback. Then [Part 4](part4.md) awaits.
